## ✨ Project Vision

Every real-world application starts with an idea — and this one brings together complexity, clarity, and real use-case potential. Forget coffee machines and ATMs: we're building a **transport ticketing system** that's closer to the real-world challenges modern developers face.

🚆 **Booking, cancelling, and managing tickets**  
🛡️ **Security-first design**  
🕒 **Real-time data integrity**  
🔌 **External service integrations (e.g. social login)**

---

## 🧩 Why This Project?

This system represents a perfect mix of:

- ✅ **High security** – avoid overbooking, data leaks, and transaction errors.
- 🔁 **Real-time response** – seat availability and payments in sync.
- 🔗 **Integration-ready** – social networks, payment providers, third-party APIs.
- 🌱 **Scalable** – flexible enough to grow in complexity.
